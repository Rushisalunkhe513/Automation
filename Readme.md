# Automation:

*IT automation, sometimes referred to as infrastructure automation, is the use of software to create repeatable instructions and processes to replace or reduce human interaction with IT systems. Automation software works within the confines of those instructions, tools, and frameworks to carry out the tasks with little to no human intervention.*

*IT automation can help you get repetitive, manual processes out of the hands of your staff. This allows teams to be more productive, reduce errors, improve collaboration, and free up time that can be spent on more meaningful, thoughtful work.*


### Cloud Computing:

**Cloud:**
cloud is Nothing but someone else computer.

**Cloud Computing**:
Cloud Computing is nothing but renting Computing resources.
*computing resources:*
1. Windows and Linux Servers
2. Data Storage
3. Databases


*This all resources can be given by Azure or by Automation.*

#### Virtual Machine.
*A virtual machine (VM) is a digital version of a physical computer. Virtual machine software can run programs and operating systems, store data, connect to networks, and do other computing functions, and requires maintenance such as updates and system monitoring.*


#### Shared Responsibility Model

**The Shared Responsibility Model is a security and compliance framework that outlines the responsibilities of cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers for securing every aspect of the cloud environment, including hardware, infrastructure, endpoints, data, configurations, settings, operating system (OS), network controls and access rights.**

*Shared Responsibility Model dictates that the cloud provider—such as Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)—must monitor and respond to security threats related to the cloud itself and its underlying infrastructure. Meanwhile, end users, including individuals and companies, are responsible for protecting data and other assets they store in any cloud environment.*
*The shared responsibility model is a framework that delineates the security responsibilities between cloud service providers (CSPs) and their customers. This model is particularly relevant in cloud computing, where customers leverage the infrastructure, platforms, or software services provided by the cloud service provider.*

##### Types of Cloud.

**Public Cloud**

*A Public Cloud is Cloud Computing in which the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a third-party provider and made available to the public over the internet. The public can access and use shared resources, such as servers, storage, and applications and the main thing is you pay for what you used. . Examples of public cloud providers – are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)*
###### Advantages

*Cost Efficient:* In the public cloud, we have to pay for what we used. So it is more cost-efficient than maintaining the physical servers or their own infrastructure.
*Automatic Software Updates:* In the public cloud, there are automatic software updates. we don’t have to update the software manually.
*Accessibility:* Public clouds allow users to access their resources and applications from anywhere in the world. We just need an internet connection to access it.

###### Disadvantages

*Security and Privacy Concerns:* Public clouds can be vulnerable to data breaches, cyber attacks, and other security risks. Since data is stored on servers owned by a third-party provider, there is always a risk that confidential or sensitive data may be exposed or compromised.
*Limited Control:* With public cloud services, users have limited control over the infrastructure and resources used to run their applications. This can make it difficult to customize the environment to meet specific requirements.

**Private Cloud**

*A Private Cloud is a cloud computing environment in which the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a single organization, for example, a company or government, and it is accessed by only authorized users within that organization. Private Cloud organizations have their own data center. private cloud provides a higher level of security. Examples – HPE, Dell, VMware, etc.*

###### Advantages

*Security Status:* Private clouds provide a higher level of security. as the organization has full control over the cloud service. They can customize the servers to manage their security.
*Customization of Service:*  Private clouds allow organizations to customize the infrastructure and services to meet their specific requirements. and also can customize the security.
*Privacy:* Private clouds provide increased privacy as the organization(company or government ) has more control over who has access to their data and resources.

###### Disadvantages
*Higher Cost:* Private clouds require dedicated hardware, software, and networking infrastructure, which can be expensive to acquire and maintain. This can make it challenging for smaller businesses or organizations with limited budgets to implement a private cloud.
*Limited Scalability:* Private clouds are designed to serve a specific organization, which means that they may not be as scalable as public cloud services. This can make it difficult to quickly add or remove resources in response to changes in demand.


##### Hybrid Cloud

*A hybrid cloud is a combination of both public and private cloud environments that allows organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both types of clouds. It manages traffic levels during peak usage periods  It can provide greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness than using a single cloud environment. Examples – IBM, DataCore Software, Rackspace, Threat Stack, Infinidat, etc.*

###### Advantages
*Flexibility:* Hybrid cloud stores its data (also sensitive) in a private cloud server. While public server provides Flexibility and Scalability.
*Scalability:* Hybrid cloud Enables organizations to move workloads back and forth between their private and public clouds depending on their needs.
*Security:* Hybrid cloud controls over highly sensitive data. and it provides high-level security. Also, it takes advantage of the public cloud’s cost savings.

###### Disadvantages
*Complexity:* Hybrid clouds are complex to set up and manage since they require integration between different cloud environments. This can require specialized technical expertise and resources.
*Cost:* Hybrid clouds can be more expensive to implement and manage than either public or private clouds alone, due to the need for additional hardware, software, and networking infrastructure.



#### CLOUD PRICING.

*The cost of a virtual machine (VM) can vary widely depending on several factors, including the type of VM, the amount of storage and memory, Region, Bandwidth and the pricing model of the cloud provider.*

*we pay for amount of hour we use cloud*
*also for amount gb of data we use.*
*pay for operations like query,message we do.*
